# Personal Portfolio 

This is my personal website showing off all the projects I have made so far. Currently is a WIP while I figure out how to be artistically creative.

## TODO
Add unique styling to make the portfolio stand out (Definitely use some CSS library). Tame and calm portfolio's get the idea across, but a unique website is what I am aiming for with this project

### Customization
Ideally, the website will have plenty of user customization available. How this information will be saved is TODO as well (probably cookies?)

### Filling in content for each project
This is a soon TODO, as actually getting the information will be tedious but I will not need to repeat or change this part. Ideally I make it look cool and impressive, but most likely will be more of a showcase of my progress than incredibly impressive projects.

### Logo and proper SEO
I have very little information on SEO, so I'll probably have to look into that. I heard that hosting the website via an express backend and heroku can work...

### Modular
This website needs to be very modular. Already it has a good basis in which I store information in pretty much just one place, but overtime I need to manage this and keep it properly done.
